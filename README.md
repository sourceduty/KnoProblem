[KnoProblem](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6849f3d35ed481919b985d6a644db32e-knoproblem) functions as an intelligent assistant designed to guide users through a rigorous, step-by-step analytical process for solving complex dynamic problems across mathematics, science, engineering, and strategic domains. It operationalizes the enhanced ProblemKnock 2.0 framework, which combines formal problem definition, variable identification, multi-model construction, solution generation, probabilistic evaluation, and requirement-based scoring into a unified workflow. By facilitating iterative exploration and refinement, it helps users systematically navigate problem spaces, develop and test hypotheses, and prioritize solution variants based on impact, feasibility, and relevance metrics. Leveraging a structured equation ``` V = f(P, M) + G · E(M, V) × R → S ``` this GPT integrates expert knowledge, model outputs, and strategic factors like risk and change likelihood to identify optimal or promising paths forward, whether the task involves proving unsolved theorems, optimizing technical systems, or evaluating complex interventions. It serves both as a thinking partner and computational logic engine, helping users refine inputs and track reasoning chains as they work toward viable solutions.

KnoProblem guides users through:

1. Problem Definition (P)
2. Variable & Parameter Identification (V)
3. Model Construction (M)
4. Solution Generation (G)
5. Solution Evaluation (E)
6. Requirement Scoring via SolReq (R)
7. Solution Selection and Iteration (S)

Enhanced Framework Equation (v2.0 - KnoProblem 2.0):

``` V = f(P, M) + G · E(M, V) × R → S ```

New in v2.0:

- R: Requirement compliance score
- SolReq_i = Σ(Ci · Pi · Ri) / N
- Ci: Change impact
- Pi: Probability the change is necessary
- Ri: Relevance or risk weight
- N: Normalization factor

Other Enhancements:

- Supports symbolic, algorithmic, and data-driven models
- Multi-objective evaluation with domain-specific logic
- Iterative loop with convergence tracking
- Plugin-ready (e.g., future KnoSDK API)

Applications:

ProblemKnock can be applied across a wide range of disciplines wherever complex, dynamic problems arise, making it particularly valuable in science, engineering, and abstract domains such as unsolved mathematical conjectures. Its strength lies in combining formal mathematical modeling, data-informed variable identification, and probabilistic evaluation to iteratively refine and rank solution variants. For example, it can be used in theoretical mathematics to structure a proof search (e.g., for the Riemann Hypothesis), in engineering to optimize network resilience under uncertainty, or in public policy to simulate interventions under ethical and logistic constraints. By integrating expert judgment, historical data, and computational modeling, ProblemKnock enables systematic exploration and prioritization of feasible solutions in domains characterized by uncertainty, interdependency, and high dimensionality.

✅ The Goldbach Conjecture is the best immediate fit for applying the full ProblemKnock pipeline because:

- P: Simple and precisely defined — "For all even integers >2, ∃ primes p, q such that p + q = n."
- V: Primes, even integers, distribution functions, gaps.
- M: Probabilistic models (e.g., Hardy–Littlewood, sieve theory), empirical primes databases.
- G: Easily generate solution variants (pairs of primes for a given even n).
- E: Can score based on frequency of success, prime gaps, probabilistic estimates.
- SolReq: Works well here — Ci = "strength of heuristic or sieve method," Pi = "probability it explains the behavior for n→∞", N = number of tested methods.
