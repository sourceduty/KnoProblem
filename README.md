[ProblemKnock](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6849f3d35ed481919b985d6a644db32e-knoproblem) is a structured, general-purpose mathematical framework designed to tackle complex and dynamic problems in science and engineering. At its core, it systematically defines a problem space (P), identifies variables and parameters (V), formulates mathematical models to describe system behavior (M), and generates potential solutions (G). These candidate solutions are then evaluated using scoring functions (E) that depend on both the model outputs and parameter values. The highest-ranking solutions are selected (S), and the process is iteratively refined as more data becomes available. This cyclical method is symbolized by the equation:

`V = f(P,M) + G * E(M,V) → S`

which encodes how inputs and evaluations dynamically interact to yield optimal or feasible solutions.

A distinctive feature of ProblemKnock is its Solution Requirement (SolReq) component. This innovative layer allows analysts to calculate a confidence score for each solution variant by considering both the probability and the impact of required changes. The formula:

`Σ(Ci * Pi) / N`

where Ci is the magnitude of a change and Pi its probability, helps prioritize solutions that are not only mathematically sound but also pragmatically feasible. By incorporating expert knowledge or historical data into the evaluation process, the SolReq component makes ProblemKnock especially valuable in high-stakes or uncertain environments—helping decision-makers identify paths with the greatest chance of success and the least implementation friction.

This custom GPT, KnoProblem, is designed to guide users step-by-step through the ProblemKnock process. It asks targeted questions to define your problem space, extract relevant variables, formulate mathematical models, and generate/evaluate solution candidates. KnoProblem doesn’t just assist with solving equations—it orchestrates a structured reasoning process to uncover deeper insights in fields ranging from mathematics and science to strategic planning and systems design. It leverages ProblemKnock to help users systematically explore complex questions, rank solutions by feasibility and confidence, and iteratively refine decisions using a blend of modeling, expert knowledge, and probabilistic evaluation.

The KnoProblem framework is a powerful general-purpose mathematical tool designed for solving complex, dynamic problems across scientific domains. Its core strength lies in a systematic process that begins with defining the problem space (P) and identifying relevant variables and parameters (V), then building mathematical models (M) that capture system behavior under varying conditions. From there, it generates candidate solutions (G), evaluates them using a scoring function that accounts for both modeling outputs and parameter values (E), and finally selects optimal solutions (S) based on a confidence-weighted ranking. This method is not only iterative—allowing continuous refinement as more data becomes available—but also integrates expert knowledge and historical data through its unique Solution Requirement component (SolReq). This SolReq score measures how likely a given solution is to meet all defined requirements, offering a sophisticated alternative to traditional trial-and-error or brute-force approaches.

Because of its comprehensive and model-driven nature, KnoProblem can be applied to solving conjectures, including those in pure mathematics like Fermat’s Last Theorem. By redefining a conjecture as a problem space and applying model-based exploration, the framework can break down seemingly intractable problems into analyzable components. For example, it encourages probing various specific cases, modeling behaviors (like the equation x^n + y^n = z^n for different values of n), and using probabilistic reasoning to rank potential solution paths. Rather than attempting a full proof in one leap, the method supports generating and evaluating multiple hypotheses, which can then be prioritized based on how plausible or promising they are given existing knowledge. This makes it a valuable tool for structured exploration of mathematical conjectures—even if it doesn’t produce formal proofs directly, it significantly aids in narrowing down the most viable avenues for deep theoretical work.
