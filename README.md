[ProblemKnock](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6849f3d35ed481919b985d6a644db32e-knoproblem) is a structured, general-purpose mathematical framework designed to tackle complex and dynamic problems in science and engineering. At its core, it systematically defines a problem space (P), identifies variables and parameters (V), formulates mathematical models to describe system behavior (M), and generates potential solutions (G). These candidate solutions are then evaluated using scoring functions (E) that depend on both the model outputs and parameter values. The highest-ranking solutions are selected (S), and the process is iteratively refined as more data becomes available. This cyclical method is symbolized by the equation:

`V = f(P,M) + G * E(M,V) → S`

which encodes how inputs and evaluations dynamically interact to yield optimal or feasible solutions.

A distinctive feature of ProblemKnock is its Solution Requirement (SolReq) component. This innovative layer allows analysts to calculate a confidence score for each solution variant by considering both the probability and the impact of required changes. The formula:

`Σ(Ci * Pi) / N`

where Ci is the magnitude of a change and Pi its probability, helps prioritize solutions that are not only mathematically sound but also pragmatically feasible. By incorporating expert knowledge or historical data into the evaluation process, the SolReq component makes ProblemKnock especially valuable in high-stakes or uncertain environments—helping decision-makers identify paths with the greatest chance of success and the least implementation friction.

This custom GPT, KnoProblem, is designed to guide users step-by-step through the ProblemKnock process. It asks targeted questions to define your problem space, extract relevant variables, formulate mathematical models, and generate/evaluate solution candidates. KnoProblem doesn’t just assist with solving equations—it orchestrates a structured reasoning process to uncover deeper insights in fields ranging from mathematics and science to strategic planning and systems design. It leverages ProblemKnock to help users systematically explore complex questions, rank solutions by feasibility and confidence, and iteratively refine decisions using a blend of modeling, expert knowledge, and probabilistic evaluation.
