KnoProblem 2.5: Advanced Adaptive Framework for Complex Dynamic Problems

PURPOSE:

An extensible systems-mathematics framework designed to solve complex dynamic problems across scientific, engineering, and mathematical domains. KnoProblem 2.5 incorporates adaptive modeling, probabilistic reasoning, and intelligent generation-evaluation mechanisms, packaged into an iterative architecture that scales with uncertainty, domain complexity, and solution diversity.

CORE EQUATION:

V = f(P, M) + G · E(M, V) × R → S

With enhanced components:

- P: Problem space (structured definition, assumptions, constraints, contextual tags)
- V: Variables and parameters (including latent, uncertain, or probabilistic factors)
- M: Mathematical models (symbolic, algorithmic, data-driven, hybrid)
- G: Generator of candidate solution variants
- E(M,V): Evaluation score based on domain-specific multi-criteria
- R: Requirement compliance (includes SolReq enhancement)
- S: Final solution set, selected and refined iteratively

STAGE-WISE PROCESS

1. Define Problem Space (P)

- Formally articulate objective, context, and domain
- Use ontologies for problem classification
- Embed background knowledge and constraints

2. Identify Variables and Parameters (V)

- Include explicit, latent, and uncertain variables
- Apply sensitivity mapping
- Use priors and expert elicitation for initialization

3. Construct Models (M)

- Combine symbolic reasoning, simulation, ML (e.g., PINNs, symbolic regression)
- Embed ensemble models and real-time data assimilation
- Apply counterfactual and robustness tests

4. Generate Candidate Solutions (G)

- Implement stochastic and constraint-aware generation (e.g., evolutionary search, Monte Carlo Tree Search, constrained generative models)
- Enforce solution diversity to avoid premature convergence

5. Evaluate Candidates (E)

- Customize scoring per domain (accuracy, complexity, tractability, feasibility)
- Incorporate qualitative expert assessments where needed
- Use kernel-based and nonlinear aggregations to model interaction effects

6. Apply Solution Requirement Metric (R)

- Use updated SolReq:
  - SolReq_i = Σ(Ci · Pi · Ri) / N
  - Ci = Change impact
  - Pi = Probability the change is necessary (Bayesian learning or structured elicitation)
  - Ri = Relevance or risk weight (e.g., ethical, strategic, computational)
  - N = Number of potential changes
- Allow feedback loops via empirical or simulated scenario tests

7. Select and Refine Solutions (S)

- Rank candidates via E × R
- Support expert-assisted selection or automated acceptance
- Iteratively update V, M, G, and even P based on outcome diagnostics

NEW FEATURES IN VERSION 2.5

- Adaptive validation via ensemble and real-time feedback
- Symbolic + data-driven hybrid modeling support
- Bayesian updating of Pi, structured consensus modeling of Ci
- Nonlinear evaluation and requirement aggregation
- Integrated causal inference layer to trace system impact
- Modular plug-in architecture for domain-specific solvers
- KnoSDK: cloud-deployable toolkit with logging, benchmarking, and visualization

APPLICATION DOMAINS:

- Science: Model verification of unsolved physical laws
- Engineering: Design under uncertainty and resilience stress testing
- Math: Structured exploration of conjecture spaces (e.g., Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer)

KnoProblem 2.5 transcends classical modeling by embedding continuous learning, multi-layered reasoning, and strategic prioritization into a single actionable framework that adapts across disciplines and problem scales.
