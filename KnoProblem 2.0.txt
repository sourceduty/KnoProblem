KnoProblem 2.0: Enhanced Framework for Solving Complex Dynamic Problems

Purpose:
An advanced mathematical and systems-thinking framework for solving complex dynamic problems across science, engineering, and abstract domains (e.g., unsolved mathematics) by iteratively navigating a solution space informed by data, logic, models, and probabilities.

CORE EQUATION
V = f(P, M) + G · E(M, V) × R → S

Where:
- P: Problem space (formally defined question, context, goals, and constraints)
- V: Variables and parameters
- M: Mathematical models representing system behavior under different conditions
- G: Generator of candidate solution variants based on M and V
- E(M,V): Evaluation score of each solution based on defined criteria and output
- R: Requirement compliance metric, incorporating change impact and likelihood
- S: Selected optimal/feasible solutions

STAGES OF THE FRAMEWORK

1. Define Problem Space (P)
- Formalize the objective (e.g., proof, optimization, classification)
- Tag problem by domain (topology, systems, algebra, etc.)
- Specify constraints, assumptions, background knowledge

2. Identify Variables and Parameters (V)
- Enumerate explicit and latent variables
- Apply sensitivity and uncertainty mapping
- Incorporate expert data and/or priors where available

3. Build Models (M)
- Construct symbolic, algorithmic, or data-driven models
- Allow multiple models per problem instance
- Validate with known cases or ground truth if applicable

4. Generate Candidate Solutions (G)
- Use generative techniques: logical reasoning, AI-driven search, simulation, symbolic manipulation
- Combine heuristic and formal methods
- Maintain diversity in variant generation

5. Evaluate Candidates (E)
- Use scoring functions customized to the domain and context
- Allow multi-objective scoring (accuracy, complexity, tractability)
- Integrate qualitative judgment where needed

6. Apply Solution Requirement Metric (R)
- Use SolReq formula:
  - SolReq_i = Σ(Ci · Pi · Ri) / N
  - Ci = Change impact
  - Pi = Probability the change is necessary or correct
  - Ri = Relevance/risk weight (based on strategic, computational, or ethical factors)
  - N = Normalization factor (number of changes)

7. Select and Refine Solutions (S)
- Rank solutions by combined score (E × R)
- Present top solutions for expert review or automated acceptance
- Iteratively refine P, V, M, G based on new insights or failures

ENHANCEMENTS OVER PRIOR VERSION
- Explicit integration of risk/relevance weighting (Ri)
- Modular handling of multiple model types and evaluation layers
- Better support for data-driven, symbolic, and hybrid approaches
- Formal iterative loop with convergence criteria and traceable logic chains
- Plug-in compatibility for domain-specific engines and toolkits

APPLICATION EXAMPLES
- Mathematics: Apply to Riemann Hypothesis using number-theoretic models and hypothesis-driven proof search.
- Engineering: Optimize network design under load-balancing, cost, and redundancy constraints.
- Policy: Simulate intervention strategies with probabilistic models under ethical and logistic criteria.

FUTURE EXTENSIONS
- Empirical validation via benchmark problems
- Ontology-based problem classification
- Probabilistic logic integration (Bayesian symbolic reasoning)
- Deployment as API or toolkit (KnoSDK)

KnoProblem 2.0 provides a robust, extensible, and adaptive framework for solving the world’s hardest problems by marrying formal reasoning, generative exploration, and probabilistic evaluation in an iterative workflow.
